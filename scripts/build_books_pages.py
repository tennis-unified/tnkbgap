Auto-generate reader pages for every PDF in site/books/.

Each PDF gets:
- A slug-based folder under docs/books/read/<slug>/
- An index.md with the iframe + download link
- Pre-extracted frontmatter (title, author inferred from filename, domain auto-categorised)

Then this script also rewrites docs/books/index.md with all books listed.
